### tools

[CookCLI](https://github.com/cooklang/CookCLI): A command-line tool
for creating recipes and shopping lists using the 
[Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/spec) markup language

[meanrecipe](https://github.com/schollz/meanrecipe): A command-line 
tool and web app to determine an average or "consensus" recipe from 
thousands of possible versions of a given recipe

[disperse](https://github.com/edibotopic/disperse): A web-based 
implementation of the Dispersed System Formalism (DSF), focused on the 
procedural generation of systems consisting of topologically related 
phases. Based on descriptions of DSF outlined by Professor Hervé This 
in a series of articles in food and pharmaceutical journals

[Random Taco Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doopstudio.randomtacomaker&hl=en_IE&gl=US): 
A mobile app for randomly generating taco recipes, builing on the 
[TacoFancy API](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy)

[is-vegan](https://github.com/hmontazeri/is-vegan): javascript-based 
tool to determine whether a food ingredient is vegan 

[recipe-grid](https://github.com/mossblaser/recipe_grid): Python 
utilities and library for converting recipe markup in tabular form 
that combines ingredients and steps in a clear and concise visual 
manner

### languages

[Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/spec): A markup language for 
writing recipes that can be parsed and syntax-highlighted

[DSF](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/Two_formalisms_for_IJP_revised.pdf): 
A semi-formal language developed for describing food systems by 
Professor Hervé This, which is an amalgamation of two earlier 
formalisms: the complex dispersed systems formalism (CDS) and the 
non-periodic organisation space (NPOS) formalism

[RxOL](http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/CompCook.html): Described in 
this short book by David A. Mundie from 1985, a formal language 
(RxOL) and accompanying software (Cocina) for programmatically 
analysing and generating recipes.

### Concepts

[cooking-patterns repository](https://github.com/appplemac/cooking-patterns): 
a collection of "cooking patterns", abstractions that can be 
instantiated as different common recipes depending on choices made 
during meal preparation, yielding "variations"

[cooking-patterns explanation](https://alexey.ch/post/2015/02/cooking-patterns/): 
article explaining the cooking patterns concept

[tacofancy](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy): A repository of 
taco recipes written according the Object Oriented paradigm

### APIs

[Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/):
An open-source food product database with a free API.

[EU Agridata](https://agridata.ec.europa.eu/extensions/DataPortal/API_Documentation.html): 
An agriculture and food database with a free API made available through
the official website of the European Union

[USDA Food Data Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html): 
A free API with nutritional data for different food products made
available by the US Department of Agriculture.

### writing 

[GRIMGRAINS](https://grimgrains.com/site/home.html): cooking blog 
maintained by hundred rabbits, a programmer and illustrator who live 
(and cook) on a boat 

### games

[Educational Food Game](https://github.com/begalv/Educational-Food-Game): 
A serious game for teaching nutritional concepts developed using Python

### ontologies

[foodon](https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon)

### lists

[awesome-food](https://github.com/jzarca01/awesome-food): Curated list 
of projects on food-related topics on Github
