[DSF](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/Two_formalisms_for_IJP_revised.pdf): A semi-formal language developed for describing food systems by Professor Hervé This, which is an amalgamation of two earlier formalisms: the complex dispersed systems formalism (CDS) and the non-periodic organisation space (NPOS) formalism
